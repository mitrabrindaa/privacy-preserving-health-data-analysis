# Privacy-Preserving Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates privacy-preserving health data analysis using Differential Privacy and machine learning. The goal is to analyze health data and build predictive models while protecting patient privacy.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Explore and visualize health data to understand distributions and relationships.
- **Differential Privacy:** Add Laplace noise to numeric data to protect individual privacy before analysis.
- **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:** Group rare classes, balance the dataset, and train/tune models on privacy-preserved data.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Use oversampling to ensure robust model performance.

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitrabrindaa/privacy-preserving-health-data-analysis.git
