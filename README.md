# Privacy-Preserving Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) to health data analysis. The aim is to analyze health data while ensuring that patient privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, PySyft, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. Visualize trends, patterns, and distributions.
- **Differential Privacy:** Implement differential privacy techniques to ensure that the analysis does not compromise individual privacy.
- **Homomorphic Encryption:** Apply homomorphic encryption to enable computations on encrypted data, allowing data analysis without decrypting sensitive information.
- **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC):** Utilize SMPC to enable collaborative analysis across multiple parties without sharing raw data.
- **Anonymization:** Apply data anonymization techniques to remove or obfuscate personally identifiable information.
