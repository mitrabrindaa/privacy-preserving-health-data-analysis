# Privacy-Preserving Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy to health data analysis. The aim is to analyze health data while ensuring that patient privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. Visualize trends, patterns, and distributions.
- **Differential Privacy:** Implement differential privacy techniques to ensure that the analysis does not compromise individual privacy.

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitrabrindaa/privacy-preserving-health-data-analysis.git
cd privacy-preserving-health-data-analysis
