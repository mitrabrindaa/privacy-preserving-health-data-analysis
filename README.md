# Privacy-Preserving Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) to health data analysis. The aim is to analyze health data while ensuring that patient privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. Visualize trends, patterns, and distributions.
- **Differential Privacy:** Implement differential privacy techniques to ensure that the analysis does not compromise individual privacy.

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitrabrindaa/privacy-preserving-health-data-analysis.git
cd privacy-preserving-health-data-analysis
