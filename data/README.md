# Data Folder

## Overview

This folder contains the dataset used for the Privacy-Preserving Health Data Analysis project. The dataset includes information on disease symptoms and patient profiles, which is used to demonstrate privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC).

## Files

- **Disease_symptom_and_patient_profiles.csv:** This CSV file contains the main dataset used for analysis in the project. It includes various columns representing symptoms, patient demographics, and other related data.

- **README.md:** This file provides an overview of the data folder and its contents.

## Dataset Description

The `Disease_symptom_and_patient_profiles.csv` file contains the following columns:

- **PatientID:** Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Age:** Age of the patient.
- **Gender:** Gender of the patient (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Symptom1, Symptom2, ..., SymptomN:** Various symptoms reported by the patient.
- **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis or medical condition of the patient.
- **Treatment:** Treatment or medications prescribed.
- **Outcome:** The result of the treatment (e.g., Recovered, Not Recovered).
- **Other relevant columns:** Additional columns as necessary for the analysis.

## Usage

This dataset is used throughout the project to demonstrate different privacy-preserving techniques. The data is first explored and visualized, and then various privacy mechanisms are applied to ensure that sensitive information is protected during analysis.

## Privacy Considerations

Please note that the dataset included here is either synthetic or anonymized to prevent any real-world privacy concerns. If you are working with actual patient data, ensure you comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and apply appropriate anonymization and encryption techniques.
